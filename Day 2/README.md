Today I have tried to write optimized code. Tried to get lowest runtime using least amount of memory. Todays questions were logically easy for me, but I had to spend more time on finding c++ functions for many tasks.

Learned following things :-
1) Typecasting in c++
2) Find() and replace() functions
3) Creating nested vector arrays
4) Concept to use max() instead of (if this > that {that = this}) - [Richest Customer Wealth](https://github.com/Pradeep17Jadhav/100DaysOfCodeChallenge/blob/main/Day%202/Richest%20Customer%20Wealth.cpp) 
5) Begin(), end(), push_back() functions
